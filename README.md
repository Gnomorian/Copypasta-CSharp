As someone who isnt a very good programmer i tend to copy paste alot, so this has helped me to no end in its previous form Copypasta-Java.

I chose to remake it in C# because I was using the language alot at work and the previous project was having issues. 
So i felt it needed an overhaul which had the added benefit of learning a bit about how the language worked.
